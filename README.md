# HT-2000Python

The HT-2000 is a great CO2, Temp, RelativeHumidity logger with a USB Connector. 
Nowadays there are cheaper solutions out there, but the HT-2000 is still a good tool for Purpouses where you need your Data on your Computer.

t-Omicr0n posted a great reverse engeneering aricle here: https://globalblindspot.blogspot.com/2016/08/reverse-engineering-slab-ht2000-co2_11.html he wrote the code for a C program, here is his github page: https://github.com/tomvanbraeckel/slab_ht2000

i "ported" the code to python by copying his code and changed it till it worked...

Thanks Tom! =)
